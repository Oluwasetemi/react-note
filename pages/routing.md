## [What is Routing‚ùì‚ùì‚ùì‚ùì‚ùì]{.text-gradient.text-4xl}

In traditional websites, navigating to a new page involves the browser requesting a new HTML, CSS and JS document from the server, resulting in a full page reload. This approach is often slow and disrupts the user experience. With routing in `SPAs (Single Page Applications)`, we can simulate a multi-page experience without reloading the page, creating a faster, smoother experience.

<v-clicks>

## How does routing work‚ùì

When routing is handled on the client side (in the browser), JavaScript manages which content to display based on the URL. Instead of fetching new HTML files for each view, a single-page application (SPA) `dynamically updates displayed components`, creating the illusion of navigating multiple pages within a single web page.

This is where <span class="text-gradient text-2xl">React Router </span> comes in. As the most popular library for navigation in React applications, React Router enables seamless route-based navigation in SPAs. `React Router enables "client side routing"`. It allows developers to define routes that update views without reloading the page, giving users a smooth, app-like experience as they move between different "pages" within the application.

# Routing Comparison: Traditional Web vs. Client-Side Routing

| Step                       | Traditional Web Routing                                            | Client-Side (SPA) Routing                                             |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Home Page**           | User visits `/`, browser loads HTML, CSS and JS from the server    | User visits `/`, React Router loads the Home component without reload |
| **2. Navigation to About** | New request to the server for `/about`                             | React Router intercepts `/about` and updates view instantly           |
| **3. Content Update**      | Server sends new HTML, CSS and JS for `/about`, replacing the page | "About" component rendered dynamically within the page                |
| **4. User Experience**     | Full-page reloads cause delays                                     | Navigation is smooth and instant                                      |

## [Setting Up Routes and Links]{.text-gradient.text-4xl}

To use React Router, first install the react-router-dom package: `npm/pnpm install react-router-dom`

After installing React Router, you can start defining routes and setting up navigation.
To configure basic routing setup, use these components: BrowserRouter, Routes, Route, Link

- <span class="text-gradient">BrowserRouter</span> enables routing functionality across the app.
- <span class="text-gradient">Routes</span> holds each route.
- <span class="text-gradient">Route</span> maps each URL path to a component.
- <span class="text-gradient">Link</span> generates navigational links that change the view without reloading.

<v-clicks>

In the basic setup in the next page ‚û†, `BrowserRouter` wraps the entire application, which allows React Router to manage the routing. We define the `Routes component`, which holds multiple Route elements. Each Route specifies a path (like / for the home page) and an element (like `<Home />` or `<About />`) that gets rendered when the path is matched. This approach is ideal for quick setups and demos, where you might not need to split everything into separate files.

<span class="text-gradient">PS: You most likely won&apos;t do this while building your applications.</span>

In a <span class="text-gradient">more structured setup</span>, each route‚Äôs component (e.g., Home, About, and NavBar) is imported from its own file. This setup keeps App.js `cleaner and allows for better organization`, especially as your application grows. As you would see below, <span class="text-gradient">index.js</span> wraps the App component in BrowserRouter, enabling client-side routing while <span class="text-gradient">App.js</span> defines routes and imports components for each path.

## [Navigating Between Pages]{.text-gradient.text-4xl} üß≠

Navigation in React Router is handled by the Link and useNavigate components, allowing users to navigate both via `clicks` and `programmatically`.

<div class="flex gap-3">
<div v-click>
‚ú¥ <span class="text-gradient"> Client-Side Navigation with Link:</span> Using "Link" components replaces traditional anchor tags, allowing for smooth client-side transitions.

```jsx
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom'

export default function NavigationBar() {
  return (
    <nav>
      <Link to="/">Home</Link>
      <Link to="/about">About</Link>
    </nav>
  )
}
```

</div>

<div v-click>
‚ú¥ <span class="text-gradient">Programmatic Navigation with useNavigate:</span> To navigate in response to an event (like a form submission), use the useNavigate hook.

```jsx
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom'

function LoginPage() {
  const navigate = useNavigate()

  const handleLogin = () => {
    // Login logic
    navigate('/dashboard')
  }

  return <button onClick={handleLogin}>Login</button>
}
```

</div>

## [Dynamic Routing and URL Parameters]{.text-gradient.text-4xl}

Dynamic routing in React Router enables `a single route to handle multiple URL variations` by using <span class="text-gradient">URL parameters</span>. This is especially useful when building pages with variable content, such as user profiles, product details, or blog posts, where each view depends on a unique identifier like an ID or a username.

### For example, a route like /profile/:username can dynamically render different content based on the `username parameter` in the URL.

<v-clicks>

In the example in the next page ‚û†, here is what happens:

<span class="text-gradient">1Ô∏è‚É£</span> When the app loads, it displays the Home component. The user can `enter a username` and click "Go to Profile."

<span class="text-gradient">2Ô∏è‚É£</span> The handleSubmit function in Home.js `uses navigate to redirect` the user to `/profile/:username`, replacing :username with the actual username entered.

<span class="text-gradient">3Ô∏è‚É£</span> The Profile component `extracts the username from the URL using useParams`, displaying a personalized message.

## [Redirects and Protected Routes]{.text-gradient.text-4xl}

Redirects and protected routes are essential for `securing certain parts` of your application or `guiding users` to appropriate pages. Protected routes, for instance, restrict access to authenticated users, while redirects can send users to a different path if certain conditions aren't met.

In the next example in the next page ‚û†, we create a protected route that only allows authenticated users to access it. If the user is not authenticated, they are redirected to the login page.

<v-clicks>

<span class="text-gradient">1Ô∏è‚É£</span> The ProtectedRoute component checks if the user is authenticated.

<span class="text-gradient">2Ô∏è‚É£</span> If isAuthenticated is false, it redirects to /login using the <Navigate /> component, effectively preventing access to the protected Dashboard route.

<span class="text-gradient">3Ô∏è‚É£</span> If isAuthenticated is true, it renders the child component (in this case, Dashboard), granting access.

## [Assignment]{.text-gradient.text-4xl}

Build a simple `Blog Application` with `React Router`. The app should have a `Home Page` displaying a list of blog posts. Each post should have a title and a brief excerpt, with a link to its `Detail Page`. The `Detail Page` should show the full content of the selected blog post, which can be dynamically generated. Users should be able to go back to the `Home Page` from any page or the previous page. Also, <span class="text-gradient">handle 404 errors</span> by displaying a fallback page when a non-existent route is visited.
