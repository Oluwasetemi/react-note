## ‚ú¥ [ useRef]{.text-gradient.text-4xl}

useRef is a React Hook that lets you `reference a value that‚Äôs not needed for rendering` - it is used to persist a mutable reference without causing unnecessary re-renders. It can:

- Access and manipulate DOM elements directly.
- Store a mutable value that doesn‚Äôt trigger re-renders when updated.

Syntax

```jsx
import { useRef } from 'react'

const refContainer = useRef(initialValue)
```

- Initialization: useRef `accepts a parameter (initialValue)` during the first render, which initializes the ref.current property. This initial value is ignored in subsequent renders.
- Returned Object: It returns an object with a single property, `current`.

Unlike useState, refs are mutable. You can directly update ref.current without causing a re-render.

## Why useRef?

They are used for tracking previous state without triggering re-render.

Use `useRef` for managing data that doesn‚Äôt trigger re-renders, such as storing interval IDs for animations or timers, tracking previous form input values, or caching API responses for debouncing.

It‚Äôs also indispensable for DOM manipulations like <span class="text-teal-400">focusing input fields</span>, <span class="text-teal-400">managing scroll positions for infinite scroll</span>, <span class="text-teal-400">detecting when elements come into view</span> (e.g., lazy-loading images or videos), or <span class="text-teal-400">controlling canvas elements in animations</span>.

Additionally, it‚Äôs useful for `integrating third-party libraries` like sliders, charts, or maps where direct DOM interaction is required.

```jsx
const ref = useRef(initialValue)
console.log(ref.current) // Access the current value
ref.current = newValue // Update the value manually
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Do not read or write `ref.current` during rendering, except for initialization.

## useState vs useRef

| Feature                      | `useState`             | `useRef`                                       |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Triggers Re-render on Update | ‚úÖ Yes                 | ‚ùå No                                          |
| Mutable                      | ‚ùå No, immutable       | ‚úÖ Yes, mutable (`ref.current` can be changed) |
| Safe to Read During Render   | ‚úÖ Yes                 | ‚ùå No                                          |
| Best Use Case                | Displaying/updating UI | Storing data not affecting UI                  |

On the next page üëâ, in the counter button implemented with `useState`, the screen updates to reflect the new count because changing the state triggers a re-render of the component. However, if the same counter is implemented with `useRef`, the count can be updated by mutating <span class="text-teal-400">ref.current</span>, but the component will not re-render, so you would never see the count change on the screen.

This highlights a key difference: `useState` is for reactive data that affects the UI, while `useRef` is for storing mutable data that doesn't influence rendering.

## ‚ú¥ [ useReducer]{.text-gradient.text-4xl}

useReducer is useful for managing complex state logic.

```jsx
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState, init?)
```

<v-clicks>

The hook takes three parameters: a <span class="text-teal-400">reducer</span> function, an <span class="text-teal-400">initialState</span>, and an optional <span class="text-teal-400">init</span> function.

The `reducer` is a function that specifies how the state is updated, structured as `(state, action) => newState` (React passes the current state and action to the reducer , which <span class="text-teal-400">calculates and returns the next state</span>. React then saves the new state, <span class="text-teal-400">re-renders your component</span> with it, and updates the UI accordingly).

The `initialState` is the starting value of the state.

The optional `init` function allows you to compute the initial state, useful for heavy initialization logic.

useReducer returns an array with two elements: `state` and `dispatch`. The state holds the current value, while dispatch is a function that lets you change state in response to interaction - you can call to send actions, update the state, and trigger a re-render. This makes useReducer ideal for managing complex state logic or when state transitions depend on the current state and actions.

Use Cases: <span class="text-teal-400">Complex state logic</span> & <span class="text-teal-400">Centralized state management within a component</span>.

### Using useReducer in a counter

```jsx
import React, { useReducer } from 'react'

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return { count: state.count + 1 }
    case 'decrement':
      return { count: state.count - 1 }
    default:
      throw new Error()
  }
}

function Counter() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { count: 0 })

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {state.count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'increment' })}>+</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'decrement' })}>-</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## useState vs useReducer

| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **üîß Best for**    | Simple state logic, isolated values                                             | Complex state logic with multiple transitions    |
| **üìã State shape** | Single or simple data types (e.g., numbers, booleans)                           | Complex objects or interdependent fields         |
| **üöÄ Update**      | State setters ( <span class="text-teal-400">setState</span>) for direct updates | Reducer function for controlled updates          |
| **üéØ Re-renders**  | On state updates via setter                                                     | On dispatch when the reducer returns a new state |

You should use useReducer when your <span class="text-teal-400">state logic becomes complex or involves multiple related variables</span>. However, if your state is simple‚Äîlike a single boolean toggle, a numeric counter, or isolated values‚ÄîuseState is more appropriate.

## ‚ú¥ [ useContext]{.text-gradient.text-4xl}

Information is passed from a parent component to a child component through props. However, this can become cumbersome when the data needs to be passed through several intermediate components, or when multiple components in the app require the same data. The `Context API` allows a parent component to make certain data available to all components below it in the component tree, regardless of their depth, without the need to pass it explicitly via props.

The `useContext` hook allows functional components to consume values from context directly, eliminating the need for a `Consumer` component. This simplifies the process of accessing shared state or global data that is provided by a `Context.Provider`.

<v-clicks>

```jsx
const value = useContext(SomeContext)
```

Use Cases:

- Global State Sharing: Ideal for managing global state across your app, such as authentication status, theming, or user preferences.

- Avoiding Prop Drilling: Context helps eliminate this issue by making the data available to any component in the tree, without having to explicitly pass props down through every intermediate level.

  )
}

function App() {

  )
}
```

Without useContext: You&apos;d need to pass the theme prop down manually, making the code harder to maintain.

## ‚ú¥ [ useLayoutEffect]{.text-gradient.text-4xl}

useLayoutEffect is a hook designed to perform <span class="text-teal-400">synchronous side effects</span> after DOM mutations `but before the browser repaints the screen`. This ensures that any layout measurements or updates are applied before the user sees them, making it valuable for scenarios where precise alignment or measurements of DOM elements are critical.

It is a <span class="text-teal-400">version of useEffect</span>. However, in contrast, useEffect runs <span class="text-teal-400">asynchronously</span> after the paint cycle, making it more suitable for non-blocking side effects like fetching data or setting up event listeners. While `both hooks allow for side effects`, their timing and use cases differ significantly.

<v-clicks>

Syntax

```jsx
useLayoutEffect(setup, dependencies?)
```

Use Cases:

- DOM Measurements: If you need to measure an element&apos;s dimensions before rendering dependent content, such as calculating a tooltip's position.

- Avoiding Flickers: When you want to avoid the user seeing visual changes (e.g., moving elements) after the paint cycle.

</v-clicks>

## useLayoutEffect vs useEffect

Use `useLayoutEffect` when you need to measure or synchronize changes to the DOM before the browser repaints, such as positioning tooltips or avoiding flickers in animations. For most other side effects, like fetching data or setting up subscriptions, prefer `useEffect` because it runs after the browser paint, ensuring better performance and smoother user experiences.

‚ö†Ô∏è useLayoutEffect can hurt performance. Prefer useEffect when possible.

| **Feature**               | `useEffect`                                 | `useLayoutEffect`                              |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| üïë **Timing**             | Runs _after_ the browser paints the screen. | Runs _before_ the browser repaints the screen. |
| ‚ö° **Performance Impact** | Non-blocking, better for most use cases.    | Blocks rendering, may hurt performance.        |
| üåê **Server Behavior**    | Executes normally on the server.            | No effect on the server.                       |

In the previous example üëà, a tooltip was implemented using both useEffect and useLayoutEffect.

<v-clicks>

`Observations`:

- useEffect: On slower devices, you might notice a <span class="text-teal-400">slight flicker</span> when the tooltip adjusts its position. This happens because the position calculation occurs after the browser paints the DOM.
- useLayoutEffect: The tooltip <span class="text-teal-400">renders in the correct position immediately</span>, avoiding the flicker. This is because layout calculations and DOM updates are completed before the browser paints.

`Key Difference`:

Use useLayoutEffect when you need to measure DOM elements and apply layout changes before the browser paints. Use useEffect for non-blocking effects to maintain performance unless layout adjustments are strictly necessary.

## ‚ú¥ [useDeferredValue ]{.text-gradient.text-4xl}

useDeferredValue is a React Hook that lets you `defer the update of certain parts of the user interface`. This improves application responsiveness by delaying non-urgent updates during <span class="text-teal-400">resource-intensive operations</span> & <span class="text-teal-400">high-priority user interactions</span>, like typing in a search box, filtering or rendering a large list.

Syntax

```jsx
const deferredValue = useDeferredValue(value)
```

value: The original value to defer and it returns a deferred value that may lag behind the original during updates.

<v-clicks>

How it Works

1Ô∏è‚É£ On input change, React first renders with the previous deferred value.

2Ô∏è‚É£ React attempts to re-render with the updated deferred value in the background.

3Ô∏è‚É£ If background rendering suspends (e.g., waiting for data), the old deferred value remains visible until ready.

</v-clicks>

<v-clicks>
Use Cases:

- `Search Filtering`: When typing in a search bar that triggers heavy computations, you can use useDeferredValue to show intermediate results while keeping the typing experience snappy.
- `Rendering Large Data`: While dynamically rendering large datasets, deferring updates prevents blocking other user interactions.

Advantages

- `Enhanced Responsiveness`: Improves UI performance by prioritizing critical updates.
- `Ease of Integration`: Simple to add into existing React codebases for performance optimization.

‚ö†Ô∏è Pitfall in useDeferredValue Optimization

When using useDeferredValue to optimize performance, a key pitfall is that <span class="text-teal-400">components depending on the deferred value must avoid unnecessary re-renders</span>. This often requires wrapping such components in `React.memo`.
