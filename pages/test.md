## ‚ú¥ [ Testing]{.text-gradient.text-4xl}

Testing is a critical process in software development that `ensures the code behaves as expected`.

For React applications, it involves verifying that <span class="text-teal-400">components render correctly</span>, <span class="text-teal-400">handle user interactions seamlessly</span>, and <span class="text-teal-400">integrate smoothly with other parts</span> of the application. A comprehensive testing strategy not only identifies bugs but also enhances the resilience and maintainability of your application.

<v-clicks>

### In React, there are three primary levels of testing:

1Ô∏è‚É£ `Unit Tests`: Focus on individual components or functions, ensuring their isolated behavior is correct.

2Ô∏è‚É£ `Integration Tests`: Verify that multiple components or systems work together as intended.

3Ô∏è‚É£ `End-to-End Tests (E2E)`: Simulate real-world user behavior to test the entire application from start to finish.

A robust testing strategy typically follows the testing pyramid, which emphasizes:

- <span class="text-teal-400">Many</span> Unit Tests: These form the foundation, ensuring the smallest units of your application are reliable.
- <span class="text-teal-400">Some</span> Integration Tests: These validate that components and modules interact correctly.
- <span class="text-teal-400">Fewer</span> End-to-End Tests: These confirm the application works as a cohesive whole.

## [ Unit Testing with Jest + React Testing Library]{.text-gradient.text-4xl}

Unit testing verifies that individual parts of the application (e.g., components, functions) `work as expected in isolation`.

<span class="text-teal-400">Jest</span> is a widely-used JavaScript testing framework offering a robust, zero-configuration setup for running tests. Paired with <span class="text-teal-400">React Testing Library</span> ‚Äî a lightweight library designed to test the behavior of React components rather than their implementation ‚Äî it enables developers to focus on how users interact with the UI, ensuring more meaningful and user-centric testing.

<v-clicks>

### Why use both together ?

Jest provides `the testing framework`, while React Testing Library `enhances it` by focusing on rendering components and testing user interactions.

To setup

- Install <span class="text-teal-400">Jest</span> and <span class="text-teal-400">React Testing Library</span> ‚Üí `npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom`.
- Place test files in a `__tests__` folder or next to components using the `ComponentName.test.js` format.

The Counter component below includes a button to increment a displayed count value, with tests verifying `the initial count is displayed correctly` & `clicking the button increments the count`.

<div  class="flex gap-2 w-full">

<div v-click  class="w-1/3">
Counter Component  (Counter.js)

```jsx {monaco} {lineNumbers: true}
import { useState } from 'react'

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  return (
    <div>
      <h1 data-testid="count">{count}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Counter
```

</div>

<div v-click  class="w-2/3">
Test (Counter.test.js)

```jsx {monaco} {lineNumbers: true}
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react'
import Counter from './Counter'

describe('Counter Component', () => {
  // Test the initial state
  test('displays initial count', () => {
    render(<Counter />) // Render the component
    // Find the count element
    const countElement = screen.getByTestId('count')
    expect(countElement).toHaveTextContent('0') // Assert it starts at 0
  })

  // Test the button functionality
  test('increments count on button click', () => {
    render(<Counter />)
    const button = screen.getByText(/increment/i) // Find the button
    fireEvent.click(button) // Simulate a click
    // Find the count element again
    const countElement = screen.getByTestId('count')
    // Assert it increments to 1
    expect(countElement).toHaveTextContent('1')
  })
})
```

</div>

## [ Integration Testing]{.text-gradient.text-4xl}

Integration testing ensures that `multiple components or functions work seamlessly together`, focusing on their interactions rather than testing them in isolation (unit testing). It validates workflows like how a parent component communicates with its children or how a form submits data to an API.

This type of testing bridges the gap between unit and end-to-end tests, offering confidence in component interactions without the complexity of testing the entire application.

<v-clicks>

‚ö†Ô∏è Jest and React Testing Library can be used for integration testing.

### Examples of when to use integration tests{.text-gradient.text-4xl}

- To validate components that share state or props.
- To test workflows involving multiple interacting components.
- To ensure UI interactions trigger the correct behavior across components.

In the Todo example on the next page üëâ, the app consists of three components: InputField for entering tasks, TodoList for displaying tasks, and TodoApp for managing state and integrating the other components into a functional workflow.

The tests ensure that InputField correctly adds tasks and that TodoList displays tasks managed by TodoApp.

## [ End to End Testing - (E2E)]{.text-gradient.text-4xl}

End-to-End (E2E) testing verifies the entire application flow, simulating real-world user interactions and ensuring that everything works as expected from start to finish. Unlike unit or integration tests that focus on isolated components or their interactions, `E2E tests cover full workflows and validate the complete system`, including interactions with external services (APIs, databases, etc.).

It verifies that:

- The application functions correctly when accessed by a user.
- Different components work together as intended, from the frontend to backend.
- There are no broken links, errors, or unexpected behaviors in the user experience.

üí°In an E2E test for a TodoApp, you would verify that a user can open the app, add a task, see the task appear in the list, and either complete or delete the task.

Some popular tools for E2E testing include:

1Ô∏è‚É£ <span class="text-teal-400">Cypress</span>: A popular tool for E2E testing, great for fast and reliable testing with a rich interface.

2Ô∏è‚É£ <span class="text-teal-400">Playwright</span>: An open-source framework built specifically for E2E testing
